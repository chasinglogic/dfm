# dfm
A dotfile manager for pair programmers.

Dotfile Manager will allow you to create "profiles" for dotfiles underneath one
unix account and easily switch between them. It requires a git repo with your
dotfiles in it and that the dotfiles be placed how you want them represented in
your home directory.

## Installation
The easiest (and currently only) way to install dfm is using pip

```bash
pip install dfm
```
