# **D**otfile **F**ile **M**anager
A dotfile manager for lazy people and pair programmers.

Dot File Manager will allow you to create "profiles" for dotfiles underneath one
unix account and easily switch between them. It requires a git repo with your
dotfiles in it and that the dotfiles be placed how you want them represented in
your home directory.

It does not require that the dotfiles in your repo start with dots though it handles
either case equally well.

## Installation
The easiest (and currently only) way to install dfm is using pip

```bash
pip install dfm
```

If you're on ubuntu or a system that ships with python 2 you probably need
to use pip3

```bash
pip3 install dfm
```
